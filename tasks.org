* Examples
** TODO Find LLVM IR-relevant example for paper "case study"
- mem2reg doesn't seem like the ideal "separation-logic" application
- "imperative map" that doesn't mutate linked list connections
  - iterators in rust
  - e.g. loop fusion
  - how rustc compilation pipeline interacts with clang?

** Small examples
*** DONE load & call swap (readonly)
*** TODO store & call swap (argmemonly)
*** TODO delay store
*** TODO example with `while` loop
**** TODO come up with example (LICM)
*** store-forwarding
store %ptr %v
call foo ()
%a = load %ptr

->
call foo ()
%a = v

* Inlining calls
Might involve mrec, see mrec operator with eutt_ev

* Attribute combinations
See section 4.3.4 of technical document

* Aliasing
`noalias` attribute

* Termination-relevant attributes
`noreturn`, `willreturn`, `mustprogress`

The above attributes should morally be easy to specify, and necessary for
showing certain optimizations to be valid.

* Adequacy statement
** DONE UB and exceptions
The simulation assumes that (1) there are no exceptions thrown in the source
program, and (2) having UB in source subsumes all target behavior.

-> updated adequacy w.r.t. new simulation

** TODO Instantiate adequacy with VIR instance
*** Connect the simulation to the top-layer
[interp_mcfg3] includes the interpretation to memory, but in order to properly
correspond to an interpretation layer on the vellvm side, it is necessary to
connect the rest of the state as well.
*** See if [lang_REv] and [lang_RAns] is OK
Necessary to characterize the leaking protocol for [lang_RAns] which is reflected
in interpretation.
(There is no valid semantic interpretation of external calls that leak pointers
without attribute assumptions)

A. Readonly (trivial)
B. Argmemonly
   Pointer arguments passed onto external calls belong to a public relation, and
   because argmemonly states exclusive ownership over the entire block (allowing
   for integer arithmetic given a pointer head), the external call is given
   proper, full ownership of the pointers. Thus, it is possible to restate the
   state interpretation
C. Structured injections, leaking pointers
   Subjective, internal view vs. External view of memory (compcomp)
