* Sketch of proof obligations remaining

Rough rule of thumb: "Utility lemmas" are "obviously true" properties

Although we "shouldn't prioritize utility lemmas", there's quite a few
of them left and I would really appreciate some help with those if possible.

The most important obligations definitely are those in [fundamental.v]
and [contextual.v]. I've been all over the place while proving the obligations
there, so I haven't been able to carve out a sensible portion that can be
parallelized for those obligations. (You can take a look at the obligations
in [contextual.v] if you would like, please pardon the mess in these proofs
right now).

1. [EASY UTILITY LEMMAS]

   All admits here are EASY (straightforward, or obvious corollaries)

   - [util.v] : totally standalone utility functions (4 admits)

   - vir/heap.v vir/local.v: [Countable, EqDecision] (3 admits)
   - vir/heapbij.v Facts about [uval_rel] (2 admits)
   - vir/heap.v : facts about converting [vir_logical_view] (1 admit)
   - vir/bij_law.v: corollary of other properties (1 admit)

2. simulation/sim_properties [IRENE] (1 admit)
   - [sim_expr'_tau_inv] : MEDIUM (there is an analogous lemma for [sim_expr]

3. repairing [MemoryTheory] lemmas (4 admits)
   - EASY (should involve some amount of tedium, though)

4. repair [Theory/Refinement.v] lemma (1 admit)
   - EASY (should involve some amount of tedium, though)

4. vir/fundamental
   A. Utility lemmas ([Section Utils]) has some MEDIUM difficulty
      utility lemmas
   B. [Irene has a strong lock on this] Main lemmas in [fundamental]
      (Please do not touch for now;
        they're MEDIUM-HARD but the invariant is in flux)
     There are multiple lemmas that are "in-progress" right now so
     it would be difficult to jump in..

5. vir/contextual
   N.B. [soundness] Theorem admit is "trivial" in the sense that
   we just need to glue the available lemmas together...

   - [denote_mcfg_compatibility] : HARD
   - [union_compatibility] : MEDIUM
