# Vellvm
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/vellvm/vellvm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/vellvm/vellvm)

Vellvm is an ongoing project aiming at the formal verification in the Coq proof
assistant of a compilation infrastructure inspired by the LLVM compiler.

The central piece of Vellvm is the Verified IR (VIR), a Coq formalization of the
semantics of (a subset of) the LLVM IR that is intended for _formal
verification_ of LLVM-based software.
It is being developed at the University of Pennsylvania as part of the DeepSpec project.

After VIR, the second component whose development is reaching maturity is the verification of 
a verified front-end for the [Helix](https://github.com/vzaliva/helix) chain of compilation.

# Structure of the development

The development is organized as follows.

## Local libraries

Stored in the `lib` folder. Currently, the only dependency that needs to be installed locally is the QuickChick one:
- `lib/QuickChick` points to a branch of the QuickChick library that we have used in our testing

The library will be built as the same time as the Vellvm development via the `Makefile`.

## Interaction Trees

Vellvm heavily relies on the [Interaction Trees](https://github.com/DeepSpec/InteractionTrees). Its development is hence 
tied to contributions to the itree libraries. Temporary itree contributions not yet ready for merge are stored in the `src/coq/Utils` 
folder.

## Coq formalization

The core of the project is encompassed by the Coq formalization of LLVM IR and the proof of its metatheory. 
This formalization is entirely contained in the `src/coq` folder. 

More specifically, the following selection of files are among the most important to understand the development:

Syntax, in `src/coq/Syntax/`
- `LLVMAst.v` the front VIR internal AST. Our parser of native llvm syntax returns an element of this AST.
- `CFG.v`     the VIR internal AST as used for the semantics. 

Semantics, in `src/coq/Semantics/`:
- `DynamicValues.v` definition of the dynamic values and underdefined values.
- `LLVMEvents.v`    inventory of all events.
- `Denotation.v`    definitions of the representation of VIR programs as ITrees.
- `Handlers/`       includes the code for all of the handlers. They are broken up into files based on the nature of the event handled, each file hence corresponding to a subsection.
- `TopLevel.v`      provides the full model and the full interpreter, by plugging all components together.

Theory, in `src/coq/Theory/`:
- `src/coq/Utils/PropT.v` metatheory required to reason about sets of itrees, i.e. about the propositional monad transformer.
- `InterpreterMCFG.v`     the layers of interpretation and some of their metatheory
- `InterpreterCFG.v`      the same layers of interpretation and metatheory, but when reasoning about single functions (i.e. single cfg)
- `Refinement.v`          definition of the refinement relations between layers of interpretations 
- `TopLevelRefinements.v` proof of inclusion of the refinement relations between layers of interpretations; proof of soundness of the interpreter as described in Section 5
- `DenotationTheory`      Equational theory to reason directly about the structure of vir programs; in particular, reasoning principles about open control-flow-graphs.

## OCaml front-end and driver for execution and testing

On the OCaml side, we provide a parser for legal LLVM IR syntax as well as an
infrastructure to run differential tests between our interpreter and llc.
These unverified parts of the development live in the `src/ml` folder.

- `extracted/Extract.v`    instructions for the extraction of the development to OCaml
- `libvellvm/interpreter.ml`  OCaml driver for running the interpreter; the `step` function walks over the ITree that remains after complete interpretation of the denotation of a program
- `libvellvm/llvm_parser.mly` the parser, adapted from Vellvm, 
- `testing/assertion.ml`   custom annotations of llvm programs as comments used to define our tests.
- `main.ml`                top-level from which our executable is obtained.

## Test suite

Our current test-suite of LLVM programs for which we compare our semantics against llc is stored in `tests/`

- `tests/` directory containing the test suite of LLVM IR programs discussed in Section 6

# Installing / Compiling Vellvm

### Assumes: 
  - Coq: version 8.15 (installed via *opam*, see below)
  - OCaml: version 4.12.0 (installed via *opam*, see below)
  - opam: version 2.0.8.
    It is available via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on Mac, and most system's package managers on Linux, e.g. `sudo apt-get install opam`.
    If this is the first time you are using opam you need to initialize it: 
    + On Linux: `opam init`
    + On Mac:  `opam init --disable-sandboxing` (sandboxing needs to be disabled due to a known [issue](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/12973)).
- Add the Coq package repository:
    `opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released`.
- Finally, create an opam *switch* with:
    `opam switch create vellvm ocaml-base-compiler.4.12.0`.
  - Clang 7.0.1+ (available for Mac OSX in XCode 4.2+, or installed via, e.g. `sudo apt-get install clang`)
  - External Coq libraries: 
    * ext-lib    (installed via, e.g. `opam install coq-ext-lib`)
    * paco       (installed via, e.g. `opam install coq-paco`)
    * itrees     (installed via, e.g. `opam install coq-itree`)
    * flocq      (installed via, e.g. `opam install coq-flocq`) 
    * ceres      (installed via, e.g. `opam install coq-ceres`)
    * mathcomp   (installed via, e.g. `opam install coq-mathcomp-ssreflect`)
    * simple-io  (installed via, e.g. `opam install coq-simple-io`)

  - Additional opam packages: 
    * ocamlbuild (installed via, e.g. `opam install ocamlbuild`)
    * dune       (installed via, e.g. `opam install dune`)
    * menhir     (installed via, e.g. `opam install menhir`)
    * qcheck     (installed via, e.g. `opam install qcheck`)

Compilation:

1. Clone the vellvm git repo with the `--recurse-submodule` option
   - If you forgot to clone recursively, run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to fetch the extra libraries in `lib/`
3. Install all external dependencies
   - Note: you should be able to install all of the opam libraries  with `make opam` in the `src/` directory.
4. Run `make` in the `src/` directory: it will first compile the quickchick library, then vir, and finally extract the OCaml executable

# Running

The executable `vellvm` will be found in `src/`.
Do `src/vellvm -help` from the command line to see all available options.
In particular:
- `src/vellvm -interpret tests/ll/factorial.ll` to run the interpreter on a given file.
- `cd src && ./vellvm --test` to run the test suite against llc
- `src/vellvm --test-file tests/ll/gep2.ll` to test a specific file using inlined assertions


# Adding a new test case

One way to create new test cases for Vellvm is to compile a C program using `clang` and then add assertions to turn it in to an executable for adding assertions.  The steps below illustrate this process:

1. Create a C program (e.g. in the directory `tests/c`), for instance, `example.c`.

 - The C program should not use C libraries (yet!), which are not part of the LLVM IR standard, but the program should be able to use general C language features.

For example: the following C program contains a simple function called `foo` that multiplies its input by 3:

```
int foo(int x) {
  return 3*x;
}
```

2. Compile the C program using `clang` with the `-emit-llvm` and `-S` flags to generate an LLVM `.ll` version.

```
~/vellvm/tests/c> clang -S -emit-llvm example.c
```

3. The resulting `.ll` file should look something like this:
```
~/vellvm/tests/c> cat example.ll
; ModuleID = 'example.c'
source_filename = "example.c"
target datalayout = "e-m:o-i64:64-f80:128-n8:16:32:64-S128"
target triple = "x86_64-apple-macosx10.15.0"

; Function Attrs: noinline nounwind optnone ssp uwtable
define i32 @foo(i32) #0 {
  %2 = alloca i32, align 4
  store i32 %0, i32* %2, align 4
  %3 = load i32, i32* %2, align 4
  %4 = mul nsw i32 3, %3
  ret i32 %4
}

attributes #0 = { noinline nounwind optnone ssp uwtable "correctly-rounded-divide-sqrt-fp-math"="false" "darwin-stkchk-strong-link" "disable-tail-calls"="false" "less-precise-fpmad"="false" "min-legal-vector-width"="0" "no-frame-pointer-elim"="true" "no-frame-pointer-elim-non-leaf" "no-infs-fp-math"="false" "no-jump-tables"="false" "no-nans-fp-math"="false" "no-signed-zeros-fp-math"="false" "no-trapping-math"="false" "probe-stack"="___chkstk_darwin" "stack-protector-buffer-size"="8" "target-cpu"="penryn" "target-features"="+cx16,+fxsr,+mmx,+sahf,+sse,+sse2,+sse3,+sse4.1,+ssse3,+x87" "unsafe-fp-math"="false" "use-soft-float"="false" }

!llvm.module.flags = !{!0, !1, !2}
!llvm.ident = !{!3}

!0 = !{i32 2, !"SDK Version", [2 x i32] [i32 10, i32 15]}
!1 = !{i32 1, !"wchar_size", i32 4}
!2 = !{i32 7, !"PIC Level", i32 2}
!3 = !{!"Apple clang version 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.16)"}
```

4. Edit the `.ll` file to add some assertions about the behavior of the program.  For example, we could add the following three assertions (the last of which is actually incorrect):

 - The syntax for each assertion is a comment of the form: `; ASSERT EQ: <typ> <val> = call <typ> @<fun>(<typ1> arg1, ..., <typN> argN)`


```
; ASSERT EQ: i32 0 = call i32 @foo(i32 0)
; ASSERT EQ: i32 3 = call i32 @foo(i32 1)
; ASSERT EQ: i32 5 = call i32 @foo(i32 2)
```

5. Run vellvm with the `--test-file example.ll` flags to see the results of running the test cases:

```
~/vellvm/tests/c> ../../src/vellvm --test-file example.ll
(* -------- Vellvm Test Harness -------- *)

example:
  passed - UVALUE_I32(0) = foo(UVALUE_I32(0))
  passed - UVALUE_I32(3) = foo(UVALUE_I32(1))
  failed - UVALUE_I32(5) = foo(UVALUE_I32(2))
	   ERROR: not equal
(*-------------------------------------- *)
Passed: 2/3
Failed: 1/3
```

6. The command `vellvm --test-dir <dir>` will run the `ASSERT`s found in all the `.ll` files in directory `<dir>`.
