(* Re-export of the main utilities used accross the development.
   Use `From Vellvm Require Import Utils.` to get most utilities in scope.

   Note: We avoid as much as possible to import notations. You can therefore import 
   additionally the following modules:
   - `Import AlistNotations.` for notations related to `alist` used to lookup blocks.
